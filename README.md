# TurtleGraffiti
An art project by Anne Vetto, Edna Cao and Lindsey Simard.

"Turle Graffiti" is a play on opensource, github hosting and collaboration in code.
It is reminiscent of juvenile games involving chain-like evolution of words and drawings, and 
highlights its own ephemeral existence when it is inevitably changed or replaced
by another contributor's work. Like the child's game "Telephone", Turtle Graffiti will
begin in one form, and, through time, morph into the visions of the various contributors.
Interestingly, the systems it plays on (git/github) allows its ephemeral history to persist
and be indefinitely viewable.
